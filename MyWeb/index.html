            This is a website that I decided to code because I 
            wanted to learn more about programming, scroll
             to learn more.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
            When I started coding this website, I had a hard time 
            and I just wished that there was someone to help me but 
            I knew that when I finished it, I would feel so good and 
            have something to show my friends and family that I am 
            proud of.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
            When I had was having a hard time I wanted to help people 
            that also wanted to learn more about programming but 
            could not find much helpful information.
        </p>
        <p class="hidden">
            So I decided to make it so that this website's code is 
            available to everyone just by clicking on the code icon 
            And it will have all the info on how I made it. So that 
            anyone can make just as good as a website as mine and 
            learn.
